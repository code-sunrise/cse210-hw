I have completed setting up all of the classes for my open ended project making a potion game.
I'm hoping to hop on with a tutor to make sure I get the inheritance and polymorphism parts done
because I encountered some issues and questions
I set up a case switch and then commented it out so I could test some things and 
I wrote a comment about the general flow of the program
The parent class for the inheritance/polymorphism asignment is the component class,
which includes basic information and a display method that can be polymorphed for each child.
I think i deleted the syntax for the component on the potion while I was testing the class
I'm not sure if the GameManager and the Inventory i make will be different classses or if I will combine them
